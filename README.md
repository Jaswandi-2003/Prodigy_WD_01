This task was about to build a stopwatch web application, wherein I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times. With these technologies and functionalities, I have created an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.
